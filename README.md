Ways to enhance the speed of web sites

Generally there's 4 sets of people using web sites:
- those who visit them;
- those who make them;
- those who operate them;
- those who analyze them.

Depending on what you do with a web site, enhancing its speed may differ. If you're going to analyze a website, chances are you will not be applying the same tactic as when you're visiting or operating them. 

This repository will grow to contain some tools and strategies that help speed up web sites.

Feel free to employ any of these. I make no guarantees that they will work. In fact, some are likely to break your website experience and render some websites useless. (In which case you should ask yourself why you're dealing with that site.) 

Thus, use at your own peril.

Who am I to offer these tools and strategies? I have been building websites since 1993, professionally since 1995. Currently I'm a software architect and engineer - one of my jobs is to check web sites with which my applications integrate. And I need them to work fast. Sometimes they don't. And their management teams don't always care about my needs. I do.
